### HI there!

Thanks for taking part in the kata. The aim of the kata is simple - to create the defined layout using the layouting tools you are using. Here's the ones we're currently using, and the branch you'll need to check out:

- `no-constraints` [NoConstraints](https://github.com/amlcurran/Social/blob/master/ios/whatson/whatson/UIView%2BConstraints.swift) by Novoda
- `snapkit` [SnapKit](https://github.com/SnapKit/SnapKit)
- `xibs` Using XIBs and Storyboards

You'll be given which one you'll be working, and what you have to make for the kata shortly. Just check out your branch (it should be ready), and get going!

Oh, and maybe ask your colleagues for some information about themselves ;)

When you're done, make a PR against `master`.
